<p>Shopware Plugin for Social Login</p>
<h2>

    Product information
</h2>
<p>Social login is a very useful feature used by many applications to get the user logged in easily via
    <span style="font-style: italic;">Facebook, Google, Amazon </span>
    etc.
    <br>
</p>
<p>Give your customers the option to sign in via any social account with the help of the “Social Login” to your shop
    easily
    <br>
    and conveniently with just one click.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="New_customer_process_14"></a>
    New customer process
</h3>
<p>If the customer is not yet registered in your shop, he or she will be logged in after successful authentication
    against
    <br>
    one of the social providers.
</p>
<p>If the master data is not completed the user can fullfil them as usual in his account. In the case that the user
    <br>
    wants to checkout without all master data shopware will prompt him to enter his data.
</p>
<p>We have refrained from doing a seperate registration after social login, to prevent that the
    <br>
    user leaves your shop due the complexity of the registration form.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Existing_customer_process_24"></a>
    Existing customer process
</h3>
<p>Users who are already a customer in your shop, as long as the social login cookie is still valid
    <br>
    are automatically logged into the shop. If the cookie is not available, the customer can sign in
    <br>
    to the shop through the social log-in. A new registration is not needed here.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Special_Case_equal_email_addresses_30"></a>
    Special Case “equal email addresses”
</h4>
<p>If the user logs in via Google and wants to log in later via Facebook and he has the same email address on both
    social
    <br>
    providers we
    <strong>connect</strong>
    the identity from Facebook to the already existing Google customer account on the shopware
    <br>
    system.
</p>
<h4>
    <a id="Special_Case_passwort_36"></a>
    Special Case “passwort”
</h4>
<p>The password will be during the login process, because shopware needs a password for each user. Unfortunatly
    <br>
    the user not know this password. The only way he can reset this is to click “Password Forgot?” and reset the
    <br>
    passwort via email.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="Logout_process_42"></a>
    Logout process
</h3>
<p>If the user presses the “Logout button”, we logout him from all social providers so that he should reauthenticate
    <br>
    when visiting the shop again. Logout from all providers does not mean logging him out from Facebook or Google -
    <br>
    that is not possible ;-)
